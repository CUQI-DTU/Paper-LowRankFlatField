# LowRankFlatfield

Code for producing the results presented in the paper: Low-rank flat-field correction for artifact reduction in  spectral computed tomography
by Katrine O. Bangsgaard, Genoveva Burce, Evelina Ametova, Martin S. Andersen and Jakob S. JÃ¸rgensen


## Scripts
generate_downsamples_flatfield_and_sinogram.py takes the raw data https://doi.org/10.5286/ISIS.E.100529645 and makes it reconstruction ready. 

generate_aagnstrom.py generates the aangstrom for each energy channel

Driver_LowRankFlatField.m generates all figures except figure 7

Driver_spectralprofile.m generates figure 7
